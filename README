The goal of this cookbook is to allow customizing templates shipped by SUSE
in other cookbooks, by "patching" them. For this, we actually override the
template after it has been defined. To have this work, we need a couple of
things:

 - Include the update templates in the templates/default/ directory of this
   cookbook and modify the recipe to make sure that the resources for the
   template are using the right source (see examples below). You can also
   change variables passed to the templates, to change the template based on
   logic in this recipe or inside the template.

 - Re-upload the cookbook with this command:
       knife cookbook upload -o /opt/dell/chef/cookbooks localoverride

 - Edit the nodes for which you want to override things so that they use this
   recipe. You can do this on all nodes if desired, and use code in the
   recipe to do actions only if relevant on that node (see examples below).
   To achieve this, run "knife node edit $node", go at the bottom, and add at
   the end of the run_list the following (keep the quotes):
       "recipe[localoverride::default]"

WARNING WARNING WARNING

If you use as a basis templates from the existing cookbooks, it is critical
to keep them in sync with the source. So when an update is out, you must
check that your overriding template is up-to-date with the updated template
from the original cookbook.

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

Everything that you put in this cookbook (this recipe, but also templates and
more) might be captured in supportconfigs. So please be careful about secrets
such as passwords, keys, etc.
